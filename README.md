# IndicePA proxy

A REST proxy for indicepa.

## Overview

An auto-generated REST proxy with TLS support for indicepa. Authentication token is passed via:

        Authorization: bearer XXXX

A sample method is

```


This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.
